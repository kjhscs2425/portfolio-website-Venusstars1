    <h1>Project 3: Make a Discord Bot</h1>
    <a href="https://github.com/kjhscs2425/project-3-make-a-discord-bot-v2-Venusstars1.git">Link to source code</a>
    <p>For this project we made discord bots that you can interact with 
      I had a lot of fun with this project because it was so fun to talk with the 
      discord bot and have it respond to you with all sorts of commands. 
    </p>
    <a href="https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1329526864490004591">Invite my discord bot</a>
    <p>So how the discord bot works is that you tell it something and it will respond back to you
      I have multiple commands that you can say that will end in a response. Here is the list so you
      can play around with it
      Here are all of the commands that you can tell it</p>

    </p> 1. Who lives in a pineapple under the sea</p>

      </p> 2. capitalize</p> 

     </p>  3. 123456789</p> 

    </p>   4. Josie</p> 

    </p>   5. lower</p> 

    </p>   6. knock knock</p> 

    </p>   7. countdown</p> 

   </p>    8. sarcastic</p> 

    </p>   9. backward</p> 

     </p>  10. funny</p> 

    </p>   11. dog</p> 

   </p>    12. riddle</p> 
</p> 
    Have fun playing around with these, and I think that most of the commands are pretty
    self explanatory for what they do. 
    </p>
    <p>Please enjoy!</p>
