    <h1>Project 4: Make some Flashcards</h1>
    <a href="https://github.com/kjhscs2425/project-4-make-some-flashcards-Venusstars1.git">Link to source code</a>
    <p>This project had some big challenges but in the end it was one of my favorites.
      We had to make 20 flashcards that present in random order
      and tell you if you got the question right. It has to store
      your progress in a different json file, and then gives you summary stats every time you run it.
      Every time you run it, it takes the information from past rounds and presents the flashcards
      in a different way.

      For my flashcards, I had 20 animals and you have to write what the name of a group of those
      animals is called. Then, if you run it again, all the animals that you got less than 60%
      correct all time will be shown to you, and then animals under 50%, etc etc until you finish
      all of the flashcards. Have fun, and hopefully you learn some animal group names!

    <h2>File I/O is a little weird for the python-in-a-website library 
      I'm using.</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
      Add your actual flashcards project code into the "flashcards"
      subdirectory within this repository. (You can copy each file over, or
      you can use <code>git subtree add -P <prefix> <repo> <rev></code>)</li>
      <li>If you need any data files to exist <b>before</b> you run your 
      python code, add the paths to those files into the "py-config" tag 
      within the "head" tag of this html file. The key is the actual
      location within this projct and the vlue is the way your python
      code will ask for the file.</li>
      <li>The way I've written this, your code won't have any memory actually 
      saved. Once the user refreshes the page, all the files get overwritten
      to their original state.</li>
    </ul>
