    <p>This project had some big challenges but in the end it was one of my favorites.
      We had to make 20 flashcards that present in random order
      and tell you if you got the question right. It has to store
      your progress in a different json file, and then gives you summary stats every time you run it.
      Every time you run it, it takes the information from past rounds and presents the flashcards
      in a different way.

      For my flashcards, I had 20 animals and you have to write what the name of a group of those
      animals is called. Then, if you run it again, all the animals that you got less than 60%
      correct all time will be shown to you, and then animals under 50%, etc etc until you finish
      all of the flashcards. Have fun, and hopefully you learn some animal group names!
